# Mobile App Development Strategy for Expensa

## Current Web App Analysis

Your web app has these core features:
- **OCR Processing**: Document scanning and invoice extraction
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Expense analysis with charts and statistics
- **Project Management**: Organizing expenses by projects
- **Email Reports**: Automated analysis reports with CSV exports
- **Billing Integration**: Stripe subscription management
- **Authentication**: Supabase auth with RLS security

## Platform Recommendation: React Native (Expo)

**Best choice for solo founder:**

**Pros:**
- **Code Reuse**: 70-80% code sharing between iOS/Android
- **Existing Skills**: You already use React/TypeScript/Next.js
- **Rapid Development**: Expo provides OTA updates, easy deployment
- **Cost Effective**: Single codebase reduces development time by 60%
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for camera, file handling, notifications

**Why Not Flutter:**
- Dart learning curve (you're already proficient in React ecosystem)
- Smaller community for business apps
- Less code reuse with your existing web stack

**Why Not Native:**
- 2x development time (separate iOS/Android codebases)
- Higher maintenance overhead for solo founder
- Requires learning Swift/Kotlin

## Project Structure Recommendation

**Option 1: Monorepo (Recommended)**
```
InvoiceGenie/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                 # Current Next.js app
│   └── mobile/              # React Native app
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-types/        # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── shared-utils/        # Business logic functions
│   └── shared-api-client/   # API calling logic
└── supabase/               # Database migrations
```

**Benefits:**
- Shared TypeScript types and utilities
- Consistent API client across platforms
- Single deployment pipeline
- Easier dependency management

## Distribution Strategy for Solo Founder

**Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-2)**
- **iOS**: TestFlight beta testing with 10-20 users
- **Android**: Google Play Internal Testing
- Focus on core features: document scanning + basic analytics

**Phase 2: Launch (Month 3)**
- **iOS**: App Store submission ($99/year developer fee)
- **Android**: Google Play Store ($25 one-time fee)
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier with basic features, premium for advanced analytics

**Revenue Strategy:**
- Keep existing Stripe integration
- Mobile-specific features: push notifications, offline mode
- Premium tier: $9.99/month (same as web)

## Technical Architecture

**Mobile-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Camera Integration**:
   - Use `expo-camera` for document scanning
   - Image preprocessing before OCR API calls

2. **Offline Support**:
   - Local SQLite database with sync
   - Queue API calls when offline

3. **Push Notifications**:
   - Invoice processing completion alerts
   - Monthly summary reminders

4. **File Management**:
   - Local image caching
   - PDF generation on device

**API Strategy:**
- **Reuse Existing**: All current Next.js API routes work as-is
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Add pagination, image compression endpoints
- **Authentication**: Same Supabase auth flow

## Development Workflow

**Tools & Setup:**
- **Framework**: React Native (Expo managed workflow)
- **IDE**: VS Code with React Native extensions
- **Testing**: Expo Go app for development testing
- **State Management**: React Query (already in use)
- **UI Library**: NativeBase or Tamagui (React Native equivalent of your current UI)

**Development Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup, navigation, authentication
- **Week 3-4**: Document scanning and OCR integration
- **Week 5-6**: Dashboard and analytics views
- **Week 7-8**: Testing, polish, store submission

## Maintenance Strategy

**Advantages of Monorepo:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Shared business logic reduces bugs
- **Consistent Updates**: Feature parity between web and mobile
- **Simplified DevOps**: One repository, one deployment pipeline

**Development Focus:**
1. **Mobile-First Features**: Camera, notifications, offline mode
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core features, add advanced analytics later
3. **Performance**: Mobile-optimized image handling and API calls

## Cost Analysis

**Development Costs:**
- **Time Investment**: ~8 weeks for MVP (vs 16 weeks for native iOS+Android)
- **App Store Fees**: $124/year total ($99 iOS + $25 Android)
- **No Additional Services**: Reuse existing Supabase, Stripe, Resend

**Expected ROI:**
- **User Acquisition**: 3-5x increase from mobile availability
- **Retention**: Higher engagement with push notifications
- **Revenue**: Mobile users typically have 20% higher conversion rates

## Next Steps

1. **Setup Monorepo Structure**: Reorganize current code into `apps/web/`
2. **Initialize React Native Project**: Create `apps/mobile/` with Expo
3. **Extract Shared Code**: Move TypeScript types and utilities to `packages/`
4. **MVP Development**: Focus on core scanning and dashboard features
5. **Beta Testing**: Deploy to TestFlight and Play Console internal testing
6. **Production Launch**: Submit to app stores with freemium model

This strategy maximizes your existing React/TypeScript expertise while minimizing development overhead as a solo founder. The monorepo approach ensures long-term maintainability and feature consistency across platforms.
